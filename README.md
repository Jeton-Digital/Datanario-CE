# Datanario-CE
Datanario is a (will be a) platform where people can communicate, collaborate and grow together.

Datanario is the name of a data-driven scenario. If a scenario can be explained with data-driven figures and graphs, then it is not a scenario anymore but a datanario. So, in a nutshell, datanario is a new term for these kinds of scenarios. 

Datanario's first aim is to provide solutions for e-commerce companies. The reason behind this is that the sustainability issue in the world is obvious and there are optimisation needs in this field. Datanario aims to provide solutions to these optimisation problems, hence to the sustainability issues in this domain.

The core functionalities of this platform are being developed openly here on GitHub so that especially SMEs and individuals can get the maximum benefit of it. In this way, we can all create a difference to make our world a better place!
